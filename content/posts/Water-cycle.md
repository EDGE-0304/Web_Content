The experiment's goal was to simulate the water cycle's most basic operation, which is:
Evaporation - Condensation - Water Vapour Transportation - Precipitation
The round flask stands in for the earth, the candle for temperature, the middle for the
atmosphere where water vapor is transported, and the top opening as clouds that would result
in having precipitation.
